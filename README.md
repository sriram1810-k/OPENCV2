# male-vs-female-classfication
Designing a classifier for male and female img dataset. Firstly using a baseline model and improvising on it by selecting hyperparameters using hparams API. Model metrics are inferred using tensorboard plots. Filter activations of intermediate layers of the improved model are visualized for better inference of the model
